## Hi there!
I'm David, a software engineer with a passion for video games, music, and the outdoors. My current specialization is Web, but more than anything, I like pushing my limits and learning new things.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently finishing my Full Stack Web course at Lambda School
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working on learning Unity on the side
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my opinions on NorCal vs SoCal
- âš¡ If I'm not coding or playing games, I'm probably out singing somewhere

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-horstman/)!
