## Hi there!
I'm David, a software engineer with a passion for video games. I love playing them, making them, and even watching other people play them. I also know a few things about web development. Well, perhaps more than a few.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently finishing my Full Stack Web course at Lambda School
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working on learning Unity on the side
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my opinions on NorCal vs SoCal
- âš¡ If I'm not coding or playing games, I'm probably out singing somewhere
